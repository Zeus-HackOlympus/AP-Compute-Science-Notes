### public access modifier 

Public access modifier "mark" the classes/methods such that they can be called and used by other classes. We always keep our constructor public so that they can be called and new instances can be made of that class

### Private access modifiers

Private access modifiers restrict the use of class/methods to a particular class where they are declared and not outside it. A method marked private can only be called within that class and not outside it 


### Methods can be public or private 

**BEWARE OF ACCESSIBILITY WHEN USING THESE KEYWORDS**

An object can call public methds of any class but not private methods. Private methods can only be called withing that class where they are initialised.
